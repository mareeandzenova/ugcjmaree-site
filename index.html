    <h1>Authentic content that helps your brand be seen, felt, and remembered.</h1>
    <p>I’m J. Maree — a wellness storyteller and content creator who brings lived experience, care, and ritual to every piece of brand storytelling.</p>

    <h2>Real storytelling for real people.</h2>
    <p>For over a decade, I’ve guided wellness journeys, taught yoga, and shaped community narratives. Now, I help brands connect with audiences through authentic, story-driven content. My work shows your product in life’s everyday transitions — moving, self-care, travel, and routines — in ways that resonate and feel genuine.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Authentic, scenario-driven UGC for social media</li>

    </ul>
